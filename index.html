        <p> Cristiano Ronaldo is my favorite footballer and sportsperson. He inspires and motivates me. He has millions of fans around the world. He is the main reason why I started following and playing this beautiful game.The best soccer player in the world is Cristiano Ronaldo, but he is also my hero. Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro isn't just a normal soccer player to me; he is my role model, my inspiration my motivation to never stop trying, never giving up, and doing the best I can. When I'm playing soccer I always think of one of his quotes that he says, "Your love makes me strong, but your hate makes me unstoppable."

            Cristiano was born on February 5, 1985. He is 6 ft. 1 and #7 on his team. He plays in Real Madrid currently, but before Cristiano also played in Andorinha, Nacional, Sporting CP, Manchester United and for Portugal's international team. He won 3 Ballon d'Or (Golden Ball) awards and 2 Soulier d'Or(Golden shoe) awards. Cristiano has made 244 goals in his whole career.

            Cristiano Ronaldo's name was given after the U.S. president Ronald Reagan, who was his father's favorite actor. He has one older brother, Hugo and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Catia.

            Cristiano Ronaldo always inspires me to do my best. From all the incredible tricks and goals that he makes he's shown me that nothing is impossible because if he can do it, I can do it
